        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water (or as needed)</li>

            <h2>Step 1</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Gradually add warm water, a little at a time, mixing with your hands until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. If using, knead in the vegetable oil. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Divide the dough into small balls (about 8-10). On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a thin, round disc about 6-7 inches in diameter. Repeat with the remaining dough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Place a rolled-out chapati on the skillet and cook for about 30 seconds, until small bubbles appear. Flip and cook the other side for another 30 seconds. Press down gently with a spatula to help puff up the chapati. Continue flipping until both sides have light brown spots, and the chapati is fully cooked.</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Remove from the skillet and keep warm in a towel-lined basket. Repeat with the remaining dough. Serve warm with curry, dal, or as desired.</p>

        <div class="notelist">
            <ul>
                <li>For extra softness, you can brush the chapatis with ghee or butter immediately after cooking.</li>
                <li>If the dough feels too dry, add a little more water. If itâ€™s too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
                <li>This recipe can be easily doubled or tripled depending on the number of servings needed.</li>
            </ul>
