        <p>If you love Indian Saag from your favorite restaurant, try making it at home using my easy spinach saag recipe. Pair this curry with restaurant-style Indian basmati rice and enjoy a delicious meal that's both comforting and nutritious.

            In this post, I will show you how to cook a basic saag recipe with detailed steps. Using this as a base curry, you can make Saag Paneer, Saag Tofu, Saag Chana, and Saag Aloo.</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 1</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Clean the leafy greens a couple of times. Drain the water completely from the cleaned leaves. You can dry them on a kitchen towel or a paper towel to remove the excess water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 2</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Now chop the greens. I also use the tender stalks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 3</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Start by heating a skillet or a large frying pan over medium heat. Add oil, finely minced onions, ginger, garlic, and thinly sliced green chili (use jalapeno for a milder spice).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 4</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Over medium heat, sauté the onion mixture until it turns golden brown. I usually saute the onions on a medium flame for about 5 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 5</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Add spice powders and salt to this onion mixture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 6</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Stir everything together. If your pan seems too hot, add a tablespoon of water to prevent burning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 7</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>I added finely chopped stalks first and cooked them for around 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 8</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Now goes the finely chopped spinach or other leafy greens if you use them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 9</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Cook this green leafy mixture on high flame for 5 to 6 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 10</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>By this time, spinach greens will be wilted and cooked entirely, and you will not see any water in them. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 11</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Your homemade Indian-style spinach saag is now complete, and you can serve it as is with its delightful texture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 12</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Blend the spinach mixture if you like the restaurant-style saag with a smoother consistency. I usually use a handheld immersion blender, but a standalone blender or a food processor also works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 13</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Once blended, you'll have a creamy Indian saag, ready to be enjoyed on its own. Alternatively, this delicious dish can be a flavorful base for different dishes!</p>

                <h1>Chef's Notes</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="notelist">
                <ul>
                    <li>The classic way is to serve saag with Indian flatbreads like Roti, Naan bread, and cornbread (called makki ki roti). It also pairs well with cooked quinoa, millet, plain basmati rice, or jeera rice. If you want a quick meal, make basmati rice in a rice cooker and enjoy a restaurant-style Indian meal at home.</li>
                    <li>Use the leftover saag to flavor the hummus or as a salad dressing or a sandwich spread</li>
                    <li>You can use a potato masher to mash the saag for the desired consistency. If you chop the spinach very finely, you need not use a blender to make this saag sauce.</li>
                    <li>Want to make it rich like Indian Restaurants? Use 2 tablespoon fresh cream to make this curry rich. You can also add 2 tablespoon cashew cream, coconut milk, or whole milk at the end and cook it for around 3 to 4 minutes on low heat.</li>
                    <li>Want to elevate the taste of the saag? Add a teaspoon or two of lemon juice just before serving.</li>
                    <li>Want to use this saag sauce for meal prep? Freeze this curry base in ¼ cup portions and take the required quantity when needed.</li>
                    <li>This base curry is vegan and gluten-free. Once this saag sauce is ready, you can make saag chickpeas,  vegan saag paneer with tofu, saag aloo, and saag paneer.</li>
                </ul>
