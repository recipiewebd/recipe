        <p>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite version, with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p>

            <h1>Step 1</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 2</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer, then reduce heat to medium-low.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 3</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h1>Step 4</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="dishdesc">
            <p>Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains. Season to taste, and serve immediately, garnished with walnuts and green onions.</p>
